You have come.
I have been waiting.
I am Pi. You are now in my domain.
There is no hope of escape, my precision is endless! However, you can continue on if you wish.
You know where to start, yes? Start at 3, then go on to 1, then 4, and so on.
That's right, kid. Follow my trail of digits and see where you end up. That's all you can do now.
Have fun.
