Hi.
I'm e, the constant.
My sister, Pi, has been captured by an evil demon who thinks he can make himself into a mathematical constant.
Pretty crazy, right? He may be a demon, but he certainly can't match my sister's power. People will find out eventually that he's a fraud.
I once knew someone that had a whopping 512 digits of Pi memorized! Such a person could never be fooled by imposter, especially when the imposter has so few digits of precision!
I hope you are such a person, friend. If you are, you'll have no problem setting my sister free.
Please depart from here, restart the game, and save my sister!
...
Also, Merry Christmas!
